## About

Shall we talk about audio? I mean there's no place for that in a browser right? Annoying background sound, auto playing videos ðŸ™„... but wait! What about games, apps, XR, web assembly giving us the power to compile a whole new world in this environment?

With new policies being discussed to make it less offensive, and technologies to make it run smoothly, audio is coming of age. After rocky beginnings back in the nineties, single thread issue with the birth of the Web Audio API, things are changing and really it's here to stay.

Ruth takes us through the basics, best practises and these changes. Welcome to a whole new exciting world of sound, a world where the browser suddenly stops shouting and becomes an adult.

## Slides

I don't upload my slides due to some problems I've had with copyright infringement (As in people taking my slides ðŸ˜¢).

However, you can find all the slides within the talk in the [index file](https://github.com/Rumyra/Talk-Web-Audio/blob/master/views/index.html) within this build. It's just an HTML file so pretty easy to navigate - all my slide notes are there as well, within the markup.

For each conference I branch, so just choose the correct branch for the correct index (no two talks are the same).

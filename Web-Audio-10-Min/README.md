# An Intro To Web Audio

Further reading and resources for Web Audio In Ten Minutes by [Ruth John](https:/twitter.com/Rumyra)

## Overview

A very brief introduction to the Web Audio API, available within a browser environment. With web experiences such as art, XR and gaming, it's crucial to have an API which allows sound to be played and manipulated.

## Resources

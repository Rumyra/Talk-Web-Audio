            <p>I mean this is intrusive and pretty horrible, ur probably trying to read an article</p>
            <p>But actually there's some really great examples of audio just being used on plain ol' websites.</p>
            <p>If you're not a developer - I bet you know one - and I bet this is their reaction when you mention audio on the web - it might even be yours - I get it</p>

            <p>This is 86 and half years. A story website about the musings of an 86 1/2 yesr old man. But presented so excellently.</p>
            <p>None of the sounds on these websites are intrusive, they enhance the experience, these aren't websites you flick to, or just read, you discover them. There is a place for audio here.</p>
            <p>The other barrier to entry with web & audio is the web audio API specification itself</p>

            <p>This is the specification</p>
            <p>It's a spec unto itself really - by the way the length of that video before I sped it up was 2 1/2 mins!</p>
            <p>For those of you that aren't developers - this is silly long. Easily longest web api spec</p>
            <p>If you're not from a musical background it can be pretty intimidating to say the least - it's a reflection of sound engineering</p>
            <p>So this is amazing and stupid in equal mesures - to the point people started replicating hardware with it</p>

            <p>Now js is key here - the history of js is key here. It started just as a sort of small loose layer to web pages - but it's sort of exploded over the past few years.</p>
            <p>The languages you see here are all client side - it's what the user sees and accesses. But there's also server side languages - php, ruby, .net. These all deal with or access data or functionality *not* on the client side</p>
            <p>Thing is js went server side a few years ago, people who did client side stuff where like super cool and people who did server side stuff were like super cool and now every writes javascript</p>

            <p>Now let's say you want to load a sound to use - this can be for anything, website, app, your crazy synth, you have to make sure the audio api can understand this data</p>
            <p>So here comes the code - are you ready? The first thing we have to do is create an instance of the api to use it</p>

            <p>So let's begin - the first thing we need to do...</p>
            <p>Here I'm creating an instance of the audio context to be used within my application - I only need to do this once, this is the audio api. It gives me all the methods I'm going to need in endless supply.</p>
            <p>The context is sort of the area where everything happens.</p>
            <p>Think of it like a recroding studio. Instruments, mixing desks, effects.</p>

            <p>Once you have that, you need some sounds.</p>
            <p>Let's start with loading sounds - on a website this is important.</p>
            <p>There are three main ways of loading sounds into this context.</p>
            <p>buffers are containers data - samples. sample rate. create your own. Files are compressed, mp3, m4a, FLAC.</p>
            <p>With the top two we by pass the buffer stuff, but there's no preload - when we fetch the file in the last method we load it into memory and get retreive it at any time. As a rule top one for not many and long tracks. Middle for streams, last for lots of short sounds.</p>

source.start();

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Once you've got your sound we need to play it. This means connect it to the speakers and set it to play.</p>
            <p>There's a couple more destinations, speakers are default. There's stream destination using MediaStream API, so you can broadcast to peers with Web RTC, or save to file, or you can collect the data in a buffer.</p>

            <p>Timing is super important in audio. Whether you're just loading in and playing sounds, or you do want to take it further.</p>
            <p>In web audio we have this currentTime property on the context itself. It accesses the audio subsystems hardware clock.</p>
            <p>The web audio Api has a currentTime property. This starts when you instigate the api right at the start, but it uses system hardware for the clock and can be used as a benchmark all the way through. So let's say we load in a hi hat sound. We can simple create a loop and using currentTime, we can play the hi hat four times equally ina loop.</p>
            <p>Music works like this, it has beats and these are mad eup into bars. Sometimes you have 4 beats in a bar, sometimes 3, sometimes two, sometimes 8 half beats. It's all just maths.</p>
            <p>Long story short - we don't have to use javascript timing functions - which are dodgy.</p>

            <p>But what are these values?</p>
            <p>the first byte 144 is the message type and channel, 144 is 90 in hex and the 9 says it's a 'Note on' message and the 0 is the channel number. A 'Note on' message has two data bytes, the first is the 'key number' which I'm guessing is the note number, so 60 would be C the second is 'note on velocity' and this has a value of 100, - 0-127 (I'm guessing this means the rate at which the note is turned on)</p>

            <p>You should all see a keyboard - one of the most common MIDI enabled instruments. Now this is the data that the web MIDI api passes back to us when a MIDI device is plugged in. So let's take a look at the code.</p>

            <p>I became a web developer 15 years ago after studying degree called Entertainment Technology - music tech, film, 3D, animation. Never in those early years did I think I'd be circling back around</p>
            <p>Never did I think I would have the tools at my fingers tips to be building the software I'd be using - you can bet on other things, but I'm pretty happy I bet on the web</p>

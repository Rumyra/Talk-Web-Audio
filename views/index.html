            <p>[d] You've probably seen a dipiction of a sound wave that looks a little something like this - this is what we call a sine wave, it's a nice pure wave, a nice pure sound. like 'd'</p>
            <p>On the x axis is time and the y axis is amplitude, or volume.</p>
            <p>In reality, sounds aren't likely to be this pure - as I'm talking to you - the sound my voice is more distorted - more jaggy wave.</p>
            <p>Now what we do when we record this digitally, is we take the amplitude value at a given time, we record that and that's what we're interpreting when we're playing it back.</p>
            <p>Common rate is 44.1 khz - means taking 44,100 samples per second. Just numbers.</p>

            <p>The context is sort of the area where everything happens.</p>
            <p>Think of it like a recroding studio. Instruments, mixing desks, effects.</p>

const streamSource = context.createMediaStreamSource(stream);

            <p>Once you have that, you need some sounds.</p>
            <p>Let's start with loading sounds - on a website this is important.</p>
            <p>There are three main ways of loading sounds into this context.</p>
            <p>buffers are containers data - samples. sample rate. create your own. Files are compressed, mp3, m4a, FLAC.</p>
            <p>With the top two we by pass the buffer stuff, but there's no preload - when we fetch the file in the last method we load it into memory and get retreive it at any time. As a rule top one for not many and long tracks. Middle for streams, last for lots of short sounds.</p>

source.start();

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Once you've got your sound we need to play it. This means connect it to the speakers and set it to play.</p>
            <p>There's a couple more destinations, speakers are default. There's stream destination using MediaStream API, so you can broadcast to peers with Web RTC, or save to file, or you can collect the data in a buffer.</p>

            <p>Timing is super important in audio. Whether you're just loading in and playing sounds, or you do want to take it further.</p>
            <p>In web audio we have this currentTime property on the context itself. It accesses the audio subsystems hardware clock.</p>
            <p>The web audio Api has a currentTime property. This starts when you instigate the api right at the start, but it uses system hardware for the clock and can be used as a benchmark all the way through. So let's say we load in a hi hat sound. We can simple create a loop and using currentTime, we can play the hi hat four times equally ina loop.</p>
            <p>Music works like this, it has beats and these are mad eup into bars. Sometimes you have 4 beats in a bar, sometimes 3, sometimes two, sometimes 8 half beats. It's all just maths.</p>
            <p>Long story short - we don't have to use javascript timing functions - which are dodgy.</p>

            <p>or in fact use it for meaningless things like this guy who's literally just trying out font styles</p>
            <p>and with all these things I wouldn't even dare think about how there's no piece of software on the market that satisfy's both your making music and playing live needs so you build your own - which is exactly what Matt McKegg did</p>

            <p>This is piano - an art installation built with three.js and p5.js by Patrik Hubner - it harnesses web audio and web midi.</p>

            <p>I know that the demos here aren't really what you'd put on a site. Although pls someone build a site with a laser button. But I do hope the techniques demonstrated are ones to use and really get you started with the API and help you understand what's possible and why.</p>
            <p>My friend said to me recently the web we're in is like being in a mall - a shopping centre... we're bombarded with adverts, aggressive lights, moving parts _all_ the time. Of course we think audio is intrusive</p>
            <p>We need more parks, more oceans, more forests.</p>
            <p>Think about sound - think about it as part of design, it can be something simple (forms), animation is always enhanced - it's 2017, we don't need horrible load blaring music when we land on a page, we have all this power at our fingertips to make it really mature</p>
            <p>We're so quick to pick up grid systems, animation apis, 3d, games, vr on the web, all great things. (why we have it) But we have it now! We have all this power.</p>
            <p>When it comes to something as simple as ear magic we're reluctant and dismissive. Please think twice, I think we can be thoughtful - start a new wave of sound in our code.</p>
